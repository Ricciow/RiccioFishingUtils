After that, click on modules and you're on the folder where you should put RiccioFishingUtils.zip

### Unziping:
**Use windows extract all feature.** (I am assuming if you use Linux you know how to properly unzip modules)

**It will open this window:**

**Press Extract**

When pressing extract this message may appear:

If it does appear, **press Replace.**

Lastly, you can delete RiccioFishingUtils.zip as its no longer needed.

### Making It work

After these steps, if done correctly, run the command **/ct reload** ingame.

### And you're done!
